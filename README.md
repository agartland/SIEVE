S.I.E.V.E: Statistical Interactive Explorer of Vaccine Efficacy
===============
![Overview](images/summary.png)

SIEVE is an intereactive visualization for exploring breakthrough sequence data from vaccine efficacy trials. Specifically, we aim to aid the process of "sieve analysis", which compares the genetic sequences of viruses isolated from infected vaccine versus placebo recipients. The visualization allows researchers in the field to study the affect of the vaccine at the level of the amino acids in the breakthrough viruses and find statistically significant differences in the groups.
