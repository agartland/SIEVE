bioinformatics journal and methods paper

RV144, Step, 503, 505, all references
just fasta(sequences) and trt speifications, default methods for p-vals, 

q-vals and adj-p vals auto highlighted in some way (like vert red bars) to make regions of sig more recognizable

INPUT:
1) Fasta file with ref sequence, all other sequences



SIEVE element notes

Analysis ID
 - Identifies the study (RV144), protein (env, gag, nef), immunogen (92TH023)


Navigation area
 - Shows entire sequence of amino acids in the protein along x-axis
 - Explore the sequence using the same gestures you would on something like Google Maps (zooming and panning)
 - To select sites, hold down shift and click 'n' drag
 - bar height shows p-value by default, also available are t-statistic, entropy, and constant
 - Text field lets you enter in a site or group of sites to select
 - clear selection button at lower right
 - tool-tip showing site and y-val in upper right
 - Color = D3 color palette (optimized for distinguishability, color blindness)
 - Encodings
p-value
of a two-sample permutation t-test, burn-in=10,000
t-statistic
          independent 2-sample t-test assuming equal variance (see open R studio and Chrome windows)
Entropy
          see below


Drill-down area
 - Table
Entropy
Calculation (for individual or joint): -SUM_{unique AAs or groupings of AAs}([counts of occurrences of an AA or grouping of AA]*LN([counts of occurrences of an AA or grouping of AA]/[total patient count])

Mismaches
Average = avg # mismatches per SITE (box= per PATIENT)
Count of mismatches per site shown (would percentage of vac/plac patients be better?)


 - Mismatch distributions
Pyramid (histogram of patients' mismatches):
Vertical axis - number of mismatches of any one patient
Horiz: frequency of patient MM count
Box
Stndard box
Outliers are more than 1.5*IQR away from mean


 - Stacked bar charts
Chart for each selected site (amino acid)
Show distributions of amino acids at the site for vaccine/placebo
Meant to provide similar visual as in "Comp. Sieve Analysis" paper for RV144
